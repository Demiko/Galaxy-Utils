config_parser
=============

Overview
--------
This particular file allows for the use of a configuration file for a plugin (known as ``config.cfg``), which is
created from a default configuration file (known as ``default_config.cfg``).

These configuration files have the following format:

* Lines beginning with ``#`` are comments, and are not interpreted by the underlying parser. These can be used to inform
  users about an option's default value, allowed values, and purpose.
* Lines beginning with ``##`` are default-only comments, meaning that they will not be copied from ``default_config.cfg``
  into ``config.cfg`` when creating a duplicated configuration file. These can be used to discourage users from editing
  the ``default_config.cfg`` file, among other reasons.
* Lines not preceded by a ``#`` or a ``##`` are interpreted to have both an option's name and its value, separated by an
  assignment operator (``=``).

Here is an example of a valid ``default_config.cfg`` file:

.. code-block::

    ## DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE THIS FILE! If you need to make changes, then copy this file, save it as "config.cfg" in the
    ## plugin root directory, and edit that file instead!

    log_sensitive_data=False
    # Default Value: False
    # Allowed Values:
    #   - True
    #   - False
    # If set to true, this setting will add sensitive information to the log file generated by this plugin. Since this
    # information can compromise the security of your account, this setting is best left to false, unless you are
    # debugging the plugin.

Within a plugin (preferably in a file designated to constants, like ``consts.py``), the defined setting can then be
accessed like this:

.. code-block:: python

    CONFIG_OPTIONS = get_config_options([
        Option(option_name="log_sensitive_data")
    ])

    LOG_SENSITIVE_DATA = CONFIG_OPTIONS["log_sensitive_data"]

For more details regarding accessing the user's defined configuration settings, see the documentation below.
